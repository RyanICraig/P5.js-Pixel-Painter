Pixel Painter Project.

This project was creating using the p5.js library. <br />
Check it out here: https://ryanicraig.github.io/P5.js-Pixel-Painter/index.html

Features: <br />
  • 15 x 15 pixel grid. <br />
  • 16 basic colours. <br />
  • A reset button to reset the pixel grid. <br />
  
Future ideas for features to think about: <br />
  • A toggle on showing the grid. <br />
  • Slider to change scale on the pixel grid to include more or less squares. <br />
  • Each colour as it's own number which can be placed by the user to create a guide that can be followed. <br />
      • Turned on and off through a toggle. <br />
      • Import and export so that users could share guides to one another. <br />
  • Line tool for drawing straight lines. Additionally similar tool, but for squares. <br />
  • More colours using colour mixer. Additionally a way to save colours in it's own area. <br />
  • Interface clean up. Hotkeys to features.  <br />
